# Memory Master - Simon Game

This is a simple memory game based on the classic Simon Says game. The game shows a random sequence of colors, and your task is to remember and repeat the pattern correctly. With each level, the sequence gets longer and harder. The game restarts if you make a mistake.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors and sounds shown by the game.
3. Click the buttons in the exact same order.
4. If you get it right, you move to the next level.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends and you can start again.
